### Data Flow Example: Fitness Activity → Character Progression
```
1. User takes 10,000 steps
2. Fitness Agent detects activity → publishes fitness_update event
3. Character Agent receives event → awards XP to character
4. Achievement Agent receives events from both agents
5. Achievement Agent checks "Walker" achievement (10k daily steps)
6. Achievement unlocked → rewards distributed
7. Character Agent receives achievement rewards
8. Data Persistence Agent saves all changes to Firebase
9. UI updates display new achievement and character progress
