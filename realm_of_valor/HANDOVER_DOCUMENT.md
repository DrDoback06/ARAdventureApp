## ⚠️ **CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINTS**

### 🔌 **Agent Communication Patterns**
All agents communicate through the **EventBus** system:
```dart
// Publishing events
publishEvent(createEvent(
  eventType: 'custom_event_type',
  data: {'key': 'value'},
));

// Subscribing to events  
subscribe('event_type', _handleEventMethod);
```

### 💾 **Data Persistence Pattern**
All agents should use the **DataPersistenceAgent** for storage:
```dart
// Save data
publishEvent(createEvent(
  eventType: 'data_save',
  data: {
    'key': 'agent_data',
    'value': dataToSave,
    'collection': 'agent_collection',
  },
));
```

### 📊 **Analytics Integration**
All user actions should be tracked via **AnalyticsAgent**:
```dart
// Track events
publishEvent(createEvent(
  eventType: 'analytics_track_event',
  data: {
    'category': 'AnalyticsEventCategory.user_behavior',
    'name': 'feature_used',
    'properties': {'feature': 'new_feature'},
  },
));
```
