## 🎯 **How GPS Quest Completion Works**

### **Real-Time Location Tracking**
- Updates player location every 5 seconds
- Tracks proximity to all active quest objectives
- Shows distance and status in real-time

### **Anti-Cheating Measures**
- **Speed Check**: Rejects unrealistic movement (>108 km/h)
- **GPS Accuracy**: Requires <50m accuracy for verification
- **Time Requirements**: Some quests need time spent at location
- **Location History**: Tracks movement patterns

### **Quest Completion Process**

1. **Quest Starts**: System creates geofences around quest locations
2. **Proximity Tracking**: Shows real-time distance and status:
   - 🗺️ **Far** (>500m): "Navigate to quest"
   - 🚶 **Nearby** (100-500m): "Head this way!"
   - 📍 **Close** (20-100m): "Getting close!"
   - 🎯 **Very Close** (5-20m): "Very close!"
   - 📍 **At Location** (<5m): "You've arrived!"

3. **Completion Verification**: 
   - Player must be within quest radius
   - GPS accuracy must be good
   - Required time at location (if any)
   - No suspicious movement patterns

4. **Automatic Rewards**: XP and items awarded instantly

- **Visual Indicators**: Progress bars for distance and time
- **Completion Celebrations**: Pop-up when objective completed
- **Color-Coded Status**: Green when close, orange when nearby, etc.
