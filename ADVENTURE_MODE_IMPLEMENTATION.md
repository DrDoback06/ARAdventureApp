// Strava Integration  
static const String _clientId = 'YOUR_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID';
static const String _clientSecret = 'YOUR_STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET';

// Google Maps (already configured)
```

### 2. Permissions Setup

#### Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

### 3. Integration with Existing Game

Add to your main navigation:

```dart
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const AdventureMapScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
  child: const Icon(Icons.explore),
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting Adventure Mode
```dart
// Initialize and start adventure mode
final locationService = EnhancedLocationService();
await locationService.initialize();
await locationService.startTracking(enableBackground: true);

// Navigate to adventure map
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => const AdventureMapScreen(),
));
```

### Creating Custom Quests
```dart
final customQuest = Quest(
  title: 'Local Explorer',
  description: 'Visit 3 parks in your neighborhood',
  type: QuestType.exploration,
  level: 2,
  location: currentLocation,
  radius: 2000,
  objectives: [
    QuestObjective(
      title: 'Visit Parks',
      description: 'Find and visit 3 different parks',
      type: 'location_visit',
      requirements: {'location_type': 'park', 'count': 3},
    ),
  ],
);
```

### Weather-based Encounters
```dart
// Weather service automatically modifies spawns
final weather = await WeatherService().getCurrentWeather();
final modifiers = weatherService.getWeatherSpawnModifiers(weather);

// Rain increases water creature spawns by 2x
if (modifiers['water_creatures'] == 2.0) {
  // Spawn more water-type encounters
}
